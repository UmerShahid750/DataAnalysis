# DataAnalysis
 **Project Name**: Climate and Spatial Analysis Toolkit  **Summary**: This repository contains code and scripts for climate trend analysis, spatial analysis, and data visualization. Explore and analyze climate data using python.  **Key Features/Highlights**: - Climate trend analysis scripts for temperature and precipitation data. - Spatial analysis tools for calculating satellite based indexes and more. - Data visualization scripts for creating informative charts and maps. - Easy-to-follow documentation for using and contributing to the project.  **Data and Tools**: I work with a variety of climate datasets (ERA5, CHIRPS, CMIP6 etc.) and use Python for analysis and visualization.  **Goals/Objectives**: This project aims to provide researchers and analysts with the tools they need to understand climate trends and patterns. I am committed to open science and collaboration.  **Usage**: To get started, check out the README for installation and usage instructions. Feel free to fork and contribute to the project.  **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs` folder of the repository.
